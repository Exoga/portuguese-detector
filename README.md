# portuguese-detector
Reads ebook files and determines whether the language is Portuguese from Portugal, or Portuguese from Brazil

Why:
Most e-book libraries don't specify which variety of Portuguese a book is written in. I got tired of downloading them and searching through the text for an indication of which variety it is. This script makes it very easy to determine.

Useage:
```python main.py <file.epub>```
